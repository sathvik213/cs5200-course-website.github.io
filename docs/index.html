    <h2>Syllabus</h2>
    <pre>
This course introduces relational database management systems (RDBMS) as a class of software systems and prepares students to be sophisticated users of database management systems. Covers design theory, query language, and performance/tuning issues. Topics include relational algebra, SQL, stored procedures, user-defined functions, cursors, embedded SQL programs, client-server interfaces, entity-relationship diagrams, normalization, B-trees, concurrency, transactions, database security, constraints, object-relational DBMSs, and specialized engines such as spatial, text, XML conversion, and time series. Includes exercises using a commercial relational or object-relational database management system.

To learn these concepts, the instructor will employ the following methods known to be effective in transferring knowledge:

- Lectures will focus on developing a conceptual understanding of database design & usage, as well as DBMS implementation.
- Homework will ask students to apply their conceptual knowledge via problems and code implementation.
- Project will allow students to collaboratively complete a database application from start to finish, including design & creation/optimization within a DBMS, as well as a programmatic user-interface.
    </pre>

    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
  The goal of this course is to teach you the material to a certain level of mastery. Quizzes will 
  provide you with rapid and frequent feedback about how well you understand the most recent 
  topic. The homework assignments will give you practice with detailed problems associated with 
  the material covered in class and related to the textbook readings. The project, which we will 
  detail in depth later in the course when the terminology makes more sense, will offer you the 
  opportunity to apply your skills in a structured way to deploy a sample database system of your 
  choosing. 
  
  Assessment will be based on quizzes, homework assignments, a major database project, and 
  the mid-term and final exams. Attendance and participation also will not factor into your final 
  grade. You are responsible for your own actions and the consequences of not attending class.
  
  Quizzes will be graded and handed back with feedback for any problem you attempt. You will be 
  able to retake a quiz as many times as you wish for up to a week until you demonstrate 
  mastery, defined as a score of at least 85%. 
  
  Homework Assignments will be graded and handed back with feedback. 
  
  All Homework Assignments will be graded out of 100 points. An ‘A’ grade requires clearly 
  offered answers that indicate depth of understanding of the material in the assignment. A ‘C’ 
  grade is presented when the assignment is completed with technically correct answers, but not 
  much more is offered. A ‘F’ grade is earned when the assignment has too many flaws or blank 
  responses to know if the material learning has been achieved.

    <h2>Late Policy</h2>
    <pre>
      You will have immediately after the lecture (~5pm on Thursdays) to make your first attempt at 
      the quiz each week. You may continue to retake the quiz until the due date of the quiz (usually 
      eight (8) days later on Fridays, sometimes longer for holidays) or until you demonstrate mastery, 
      defined as 85%, whichever comes first. 
      <br>
      Weekly homework assignments will be available by the end of the class meeting each week 
      (~4pm Thursdays).  Homework assignments will be due by 11:59pm ET on the following Friday, 
      offering nearly eight (8) days to complete. You may submit any assignment up to a week after 
      the regular due date but may be subject to a late penalty of 10 points per day, meaning a 
      perfect assignment (score of 100) submitted four days late would be subject to an actual score 
      of 60 (4 days * 10 = 40 points). <br>
      During the semester, you have eight (8) no fault time travel days to use as you see fit. You may 
      use your time travel days to hand in an assignment up to three (3) days after the regular 
      deadline as though you had handed it in on time. Note that you can use at most three (3) days 
      for any single assignment, and the time travel days are considered integers (no partial days). To 
      use a time travel day, you must notify the professor before the regular deadline via email and 
      include in your email at least one (1) question about the assignment, justifying your use of time 
      travel days.

    <h2>Asking for Help</h2>
    <pre>
      Computer Science, particularly databases, may be a brand-new topic for you if you are taking 
      this course. One of the goals for this course is to show you that databases drive so much of our 
      daily operations and that this pervasiveness can be fun. This course will be challenging, will 
      stretch your understanding of concepts, can be difficult, and can be extremely satisfying when 
      something works correctly. It should not be frustrating, because frustrating things are not 
      challenging or fun. <br>
      Frustration occurs when you are working on something and not making progress, especially if 
      you are not sure about what you are doing. Frustration does not facilitate learning. If you find 
      yourself getting frustrated, stop. Go do something else--eat some dinner, take a walk--but most 
      importantly, ask a question. Send an email to the professor or a TA, ask a question in class, talk 
      with a classmate, or set up a 1:1 session to go over your work.  <br>
      We do not expect you to complete the assignments entirely on your own.<br>  
      Please follow the 30-minute rule: if you have been stuck on a problem for more than 30 minutes
      and have made no progress, despite your best efforts, please stop and get help. Email the 
      professor, ask a TA, or consult a peer. If you do not get an answer immediately, do something 
      else for a while. Please do not waste your time on one problem or bug in your code. Asking a 
      question can both get you past the bug quickly and teach you how to fix it on your own next time.
    </pre>
  </section>

  <section id="honesty">
    <h2>Collaboration & Academic Honesty</h2>
    <pre>
      Computer Science, both academically and professionally, is a collaborative discipline. In any 
      collaboration, however, all parties are expected to make their own contributions and to 
      generously credit the contributions of others. In our class, therefore, collaboration on homework 
      and programming assignments is encouraged, but you, as an individual, are responsible for 
      understanding all the material in the assignment and doing your own work. Always strive to do 
      your best, give generous credit to others, start early, and seek help early from both your 
      professors, teaching assistants, and classmates. <br>
      The following rules are intended to help you get the most out of your education and to clarify the 
      line between honest and dishonest work. The professor reserves the right to ask you to verbally 
      explain the reasoning behind any answer or code that you turn in and to modify your project 
      grade based on your answers. It is vitally important that you turn in work that is your own. Follow 
      the guidelines for academic honesty or we are done. <br>
      If you have had a substantive discussion of any homework or programming solution with a 
      classmate, then be sure to cite them in your report. If you are unsure of what constitutes 
      "substantive", then ask us or err on the side of caution. You will not be penalized for working 
      together. You must not copy answers or code from another student either by hand or 
      electronically. Another way to think about it is that you should be talking English with one 
      another, not SQL. <br>
      The following rules apply to anything you hand in for a grade: 
      <br>
      • I reserve the right to request you to verbally explain an answer or snippet of code that 
        you have turned in and to modify your grade on the assignment based on your answers.

      • You may not copy someone else's code or answer under any circumstances. This 
        includes any online code sources you may have found.

      • You may not post a potential answer to a problem (including any code) to Piazza or 
        other public forum.

      • You may discuss and work through problems with others, and, in fact, I encourage you 
        to do so. However, ultimately, your solution that you turn in must be your original work.

      • You may consult online resources as part of your course work, but you may not copy 
        code from online sources. If you get an idea of how to solve a problem from an online 
        source, include a short citation in a code block at the top of your source code file. If you 
        use an online source to help you get to a solution, you must cite that source.

      • You may not look at someone else's code, nor should you let someone else look at your 
        code. If you need help debugging something, please reach out to the instructor or a TA.

    <h2>Title IX</h2>
    <pre>
      Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 protects individuals from sex or gender-based 
      discrimination, including discrimination based on gender-identity, in educational programs and 
      activities that receive federal financial assistance. <br>
      Northeastern University’s Title IX Policy addresses Prohibited Offenses, which are defined as 
      sexual harassment, sexual assault, relationship or domestic violence, and stalking. The Title IX 
      Policy applies to the entire community, including male, female, transgender students, faculty, 
      and staff. <br>
      If you or someone you know has been a survivor of a Prohibited Offense, confidential support 
      and guidance can be found through University Health and Counseling Services staff 
      (http://www.northeastern.edu/uhcs/) and the Center for Spiritual Dialogue and Service clergy 
      members (http://www.northeastern.edu/spirituallife/). By law, those employees are not required 
      to report allegations of sex or gender-based discrimination to the University. <br>
      Alleged violations can be reported non-confidentially to the Title IX Coordinator within The Office 
      for Gender Equity and Compliance at: titleix@northeastern.edu and/or through NUPD 
      (Emergency 617.373.3333; Non-Emergency 617.373.2121). Reporting Prohibited Offenses to
